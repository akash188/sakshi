              Happy Birthday Sakshi❤️
It's shocking how little things in life turn out to be something so great.
When we first met we didn't even talk to each other, I guess that's how we are😅, but see us now.
Then the legendary trip happened 😂 and we got to know each other. All the beautiful moments we all shared together and the bus😝 and so on...
In so little time (that feels like a year) we have come a long way.
And in this little time I have found that what a beautiful person you are.
Happy Birthday once again, I'm missing you the most, let's meet soon😘.
